I (nullnek0) modified the patch file to be non version specfic and adjusted the kernel patch to play nicely with newer kernel versions 19.6 onwards as the previous patch files done by Nadim Kobeissi are specific to kernel versions and are outdated.

Fixing this issue required weeks of intensive work from multiple people.

Approximately 95% of the engineering work was done by [Lyapsus](https://github.com/Lyapsus). Lyapsus improved an incomplete kernel driver, wrote new kernel codecs and side-codecs, and contributed much more. I want to emphasize his incredible kindness and dedication to solving this issue. He is the primary force behind this fix, and without him, it would never have been possible.

([Nadim Kobeissi](https://nadim.computer)) conducted the initial investigation that identified the missing components needed for audio to work on the 16IAX10H on Linux. Building on what I learned from Lyapsus's work, I helped debug and clean up his kernel code, tested it, and made minor improvements. I also contributed the solution to the volume control issue documented in Step 8, and wrote this guide.

Gergo K. showed me how to extract the AW88399 firmware from the Windows driver package and install it on Linux, as documented in Step 1.

[Richard Garber](https://github.com/rgarber11) graciously contributed [the fix](https://github.com/nadimkobeissi/16iax10h-linux-sound-saga/issues/19#issuecomment-3594367397) for making the internal microphone work.

Sincere thanks to everyone who [pledged](PLEDGE.md) a reward for solving this problem. The reward goes to Lyapsus.
